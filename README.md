# 🎨 Geany Custom Color Schemes

Welcome to the **Geany Custom Color Schemes** repository! This collection features a set of personalized color schemes designed to enhance your coding experience in the Geany editor.

## 🚀 Overview

Geany is a lightweight and powerful text editor that supports multiple programming languages. However, a great coding environment isn’t complete without a stylish and functional color scheme. This repository contains color schemes that I've meticulously crafted to improve readability and reduce eye strain, while also looking pretty cool!

## 📦 Contents

This repository includes:

- **`abc-dark.conf`**: A dark theme with vibrant colors that work great for late-night coding sessions.
- **`abc-light.conf`**: A light theme with soft tones, perfect for working in bright environments.
- **`kary-pro-colors-dark.conf`**: A balanced theme with a neutral palette, designed for all-day coding.

And more...

## 💻 Installation

To install any of these color schemes in Geany:

1. Download the `.conf` file(s) of your preferred scheme.
2. Copy the file(s) to your Geany configuration directory, usually found at:

```~/.config/geany/colorschemes/```

3. Open Geany, go to `View` > `Editor` > `Color Scheme` and select your new scheme from the list.
